    - Use persitance
    - Get information from a server
    - Interact with another App on this device using *intents*
    - Interact with another device using **Bluetooth** or some other means.
    - Something else like these. Get an OK from me **BEFORE** you begin.

- How complicated the app was to develop.
- The range of functionality included.
- The overall quality (basically, does it look good?).
- If it is a game, is it fun?
- The Quality of the writeup. Does it clearly tell me what your App does and how to interact with it.

The Above is not a complete list - it is intended to give you an idea of what I am looking for. Please don't hesitate to ask me questions about your project.
